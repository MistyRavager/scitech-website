[Apple’s](apple.com) antitrust battle against Fortnite maker Epic Games is returning to the courtroom after both sides appealed last year’s ruling in a potentially precedent-setting case over [Apple’s](apple.com) alleged anti-competitive behavior. Last year, a U.S. District Court judge had largely favored Apple when ruling the tech giant was not acting as a monopolist with regard to its App Store practices. Epic Games was unhappy with that decision, of course, as it had wanted the court to force [Apple](apple.com) to support third-party payments which would have allowed Fortnite to maximize its revenues. Meanwhile, [Apple](apple.com) didn’t want to agree to the court’s order that said it would have to permit apps that provide links to alternative payments.
